=====
Virtual DOM

 - React follows the Virtual DOM.

 - Because of Virtual DOM, React is faster compared to other frameworks.

 - DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

 - when ever HTML Loaded into Browser Engine, automatically Browser Engine Will create Real  DOM.

 - React Never works on Real DOM Directly.

 - Real  DOM Operations Costlier Operations.

 - React, will create exactly two Virtual Copies of Real DOM.

 - when ever change detected, immidiately Virtual DOM1, will identifies the changes.

 - Virtual DOM1 will compare with Virtual DOM2.

 - if any mismatches happens between Virtual DOM1 & Virtual DOM2, automatically Virtual DOM1 will provide following information to Real DOM.

    1) Address of Node Element

    2) Element

    3) Old Value

    4) New Value


 - Real DOM will navigate to particular element based on above information and will do the changes in main DOM.
