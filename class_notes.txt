Introduction to ReactJS

    - what is ReactJS

    - installation of ReactJS

    - Virtual DOM

    - Differences Between Angular, React and VueJS


=> React is the JS Library.

=> React Given by Facebook.

=> Current Version of ReactJS is "17.X"

=> React Categorized into 3 Subjects.

        1) ReactJS

        2) React Native

        3) React BootStrap

=> ReactJS used to build the web applications.

=> React Native, Used to build the Hybrid Mobile applications.

=> React BootStrap, used to apply the Rich UI to both web applications and mobile applications.

=> we will build ReactJS applications in two ways.

        1) JSX

        2) TSX

=> JSX Stands for JavaScript + XML.

=> JavaScript won't follows the OOPS.

=> TSX Stands for TypeScript + XML.

=> TypeScript is the Programming Language.

=> TypeScript Given by Microsoft.

=> TypeScript follows the OOPS Features.

=> applications of ReactJS
            whatsapp

            Netflix

            Yahoo Mail

Installation of ReactJS
------------------------

1) download and install NodeJS.

    NodeJS, contain following tools.

            => npm

            => node

            => npx

            ----
            ----
            ----

    npm Stands for Node Packaging Manager.

    npm helps to install "reactjs".

    node tool, helps to execute "JavaScript".

    npx stands for "node pckaging runner".

    npx helps to create the environment, to build react applications

website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v14.17.1-x64.msi


2) install yarn.

    yarn tool given by "Facebook".

    yarn tool, used to download the "3rd" party Libraries.

    we will install yarn tool by using following command.


    > npm install -g yarn

    -g stands for global installation.


3) install create-react-app

    "create-react-app" is the tool provided by "Facebook".

   "create-react-app" tool used to create the "react applications"

    we will install create-react-app tool, by using following command.

    > npm install -g create-react-app


4) install visual studio code

    - Visual Studio Code is the IDE, given by Microsoft.

    - Visual Studio Code also called as VSCode.

    - VSCode is the Open Source IDE.

    - VSCode used to build the Angular,ReactJS,VueJS,NodeJS,........

website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.57.0.exe


Day-2
=====
Virtual DOM

 - React follows the Virtual DOM.

 - Because of Virtual DOM, React is faster compared to other frameworks.

 - DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

 - when ever HTML Loaded into Browser Engine, automatically Browser Engine Will create Real  DOM.

 - React Never works on Real DOM Directly.

 - Real  DOM Operations Costlier Operations.

 - React, will create exactly two Virtual Copies of Real DOM.

 - when ever change detected, immidiately Virtual DOM1, will identifies the changes.

 - Virtual DOM1 will compare with Virtual DOM2.

 - if any mismatches happens between Virtual DOM1 & Virtual DOM2, automatically Virtual DOM1 will provide following information to Real DOM.

    1) Address of Node Element

    2) Element

    3) Old Value

    4) New Value


 - Real DOM will navigate to particular element based on above information and will do the changes in main DOM.




create and execute react application
====================================
step 1.
    create the react application

    > npx create-react-app first-app --template typescript

    - npx stands for node packaging runner.

    - where "first-app" is the name of the react application


step 2.
    switch to react application

    > cd first-app


step 3.
    execute the react application

    > yarn start / npm start

    The Default Port Number React Application is 3000.


Differences Between Angular Framework and React Library
=======================================================

            Angular                                     React

    Angular Released By Google                      React Released By Facebook

    Current Version of Angular is Angular12         Current Version of ReactJS is React 18.X

    Angular is the Framework                        ReactJS is the library

    Angular is the Real DOM                         React is the Virtual DOM

    Angular have less performance compared          React have good performance compared to 
    to React.                                       Angular.


    Angular containes Rich Features                 React won't containes Rich Features

    Angular Supports the two way data binding       React Supports the one way data binding

    Application of Angular:                         Application of ReactJS:
        Gmail                                           whatsapp
        Paypal                                          Netflix
        ===                                                 ---
                                                            ----
        ===

    we will build Angular Application               We will build React Applications
    with the help of TypeScript                     with the help of either
                                                        1) JSX
                                                        2) TSX


component
=========
    Reusable portion of complex UI Called as "Component".

    As a React Developer, we can create more than "one" component.

    As a Developer, we can "reuse" these components.
